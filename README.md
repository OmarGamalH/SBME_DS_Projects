## Tasks & Problems 

### Task 1 (Shortest Queue Problem)

#### Statement 
It is required to design a priority system. You have two levels of criticality: normal vs. critical. People are added to the queue in a rate that belongs to Gaussian/poisson distribution with your own parameters. Also, the service takes a time that is poisson/gaussian distribution with another set of parameters. It is required to report the time when the service is done via normal queue vs. your handcrafted one. More critical levels is a bonus. Changing the no. of service providers to adapt with customers' need is a bonus as well
